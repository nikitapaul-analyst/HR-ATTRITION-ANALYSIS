## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee attrition data to identify key trends and patterns in workforce turnover. Using Excel for data preparation and Power BI for visualization, the goal is to support HR decision-making through interactive reporting and descriptive insights.

## 🧹 Phase 1: Data Cleaning (Excel)

- Cleaned HR dataset of 1,470 employee records.
- Standardized column headers and removed unnecessary fields.
- Created binary flags for key categorical fields (e.g., Attrition, OverTime).
- Ensured numerical and categorical consistency for further analysis.

---

## 📊 Phase 2: Descriptive Statistics

- Used Excel functions: `AVERAGE`, `MEDIAN`, `MODE`, `COUNTIF`, `STDEV.S`.
- Calculated:
  - Attrition rate
  - Average age and income
  - Distribution of job satisfaction and work-life balance
- Built PivotTables to summarize:
  - Attrition by Department
  - Attrition by Gender and OverTime
  - Monthly income distribution

## 📈 Phase 3: Power BI Dashboard

Imported the cleaned data into Power BI and created:

### 🎯 KPI Cards
- Attrition %  
- Average Monthly Income  
- Total Number of Employees  

### 📊 Visuals
- **Bar Chart**: Attrition by Department  
- **Bar Chart**: Attrition by OverTime  
- **Slicers**: Gender, Department, OverTime, Job Role  

### 🧩 Interactivity
